This is React Native Quiz App
React Native Quiz is a mobile application that allows users to create and play quizzes. The app is built using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building mobile apps, and integrates with Firebase, a real-time database that allows for data synchronization between clients and servers.

The app allows users to create their own quizzes by adding questions and answers, and then share them with friends or the wider community. Users can also browse and play quizzes created by other users.

Firebase is used to store and manage the quiz data, including questions, answers, and user scores. It also enables real-time updates, so users can see scores and leaderboards as they change in real-time.

The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, with smooth transitions and animations, making it easy and enjoyable to use. It also incorporates features such as push notifications, social sharing, and in-app messaging, enhancing the user experience and engagement.
